    libmicrohttpd (libmicrohttpd-dll.dll) - LGP v2.1 or eCos, which is GPL with linking exemption. Strongly recommend eCos which permits static linking.
        eCos license: http://ecos.sourceware.org/license-overview.html - basically comply with GPL terms which in essence are noting that this DLL is under the eCos license and either a distribution of the source code used to produce the library or a written offer to get the source code.
        LGPL license: Precludes static linking of this with commo or executables. If this is used, the requirements are the same as eCos in essence - list the library with its license (LGPL v2.1) and provide source or offer to get the source.

    pthreads, Win32 only (pthreadsVC2.dll) - LGPL 2.1. See above under libmicrohttpd. Non-windows platforms still utilize pthreads, but the pthreads library in use is provided by the operating system upon which commo is running under a shared library link and thus we are not distributing said library.
