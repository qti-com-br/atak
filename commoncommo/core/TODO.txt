Short term:
    If udp incoming cannot bind, it should maybe retry? It will retry on any
       other rebuild, but we may want to force after timeout

Long term:



Known Bugs to fix:
interface status might not be called on inbound/outbound interface if added after
another with the same HW address -- need to fire when/just after added with
up status if it is already up

contactmanager should probably listen to interfaces going down and clean out contacts on down interfaces.... OR.... clean out really stale endpoints? (need direction on this)
