/**
 * @brief Signals an incoming package is ready to be received.
 * @description This function is invokes when an incoming file
 * request has been received and the system is ready to attempt
 * to download it.  Depending on the return value, the application
 * can decide to accept or reject the transfer, as well as provide
 * a file storage location where the file data should be transferred to.
 * destFile is initially populated with the remote sender's name for the file.
 *
 * Implementations must return one of FinishedSuccess, FinishedFailed,
 * FinishedFileExists, or FinishedDisabledLocally.
 *
 * Success can be returned if destFile was filled with an
 * acceptable file name to use locally to write the received file to.  Note
 * that the system may write to this file even on failed transfers. See more
 * below about how transfers proceed when Success is returned.
 *
 * FileExists indicates that the local system already has the file to be
 * transferred on local record, and thus does not need it. The system
 * will attempt to notify the remote system of this.
 *
 * Disabled indicates that file transfers are disabled; the transfer is
 * aborted.
 *
 * Failed can be returned for any other reason that the system is not able
 * to receive the package at this time; the transfer is aborted.
 *
 * If the application returns FinishedSuccess, the transfer is
 * initiated and will continue asynchronously until it is
 * completed or an error occurs.  Progress and completion
 * will be reported via calls to missionPackageReceiveStatusUpdate().
 * Completion is indicated with appropriate status codes in
 * these updates (see MissionPackageReceiveStatusUpdate).
 * All updates for this transfer will contain the same file as is
 * returned here in destFile.
 *
 * An implementation returning FinishedSuccess and filling in destFile with the
 * same file name of another transfer already in progress will result
 * in the transfer being aborted (in particular, no call to
 * MissionPackageReceiveStatusUpdate() will
 * be made for this newest transfer as it would be indistinguishable from
 * the already-progressing transfer.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that this function is only called on one thread at a
 * time for any Commo implementation upon which it is installed.
 * If the controlling Commo instance is closed, outstanding transfers
 * are aborted (in particular, missionPackageReceiveStatusUpdate() is no longer
 * called for those transfers).
 *
 * @param destFile On entry, this contains a string indicating the remote sender's
 *        preferred file name.  On a Success return, the implementation MUST have
 *        set this string to a suitable file name where the received data may be written.
 *        Absolute paths are strongly encouraged.
 *        It is acceptible for this file to exist; if it does, however, the
 *        file will be overwritten with the contents of the received mission
 *        package.
 * @param transferName is the remote senders "conceptual name" of the package. This
 *              is provided to help identify the transfer.
 * @param sha256hash is a hex string of the sha256 hash of the file to be received
 *            (as provided by the remote sender)
 * @param sizeInBytes expected total size of the file to be received, as
 *              provided by the sender.  Because it comes from the sender,
 *              it should not be considered to be definitive; it could be
 *              wrong or missing (0)
